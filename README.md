# Eldlink
A web app for connecting volunteers with elderly people. This is my High School Final Paper.

I live nearby a rest home. This idea came when i found out some interesting data about elderly people and how many of them live alone in my state (SP).
Now, the purpose of this WebApp is to make elders and volunteers connect to each other by an easy way, then they would make this connection something more personal or not.
